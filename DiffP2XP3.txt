Differences between Python Version 2 and 3:

1)	Division Operation : In python 2 x version after division operation the result is rounded off to the floor value whereas in python 3x the division operation maintains precision and provides the exact decimal value.

2)	Xrange : Python 2x has xrange function which gives us iterator object as  result whereas in python 3x version there is no xrange function instead it has range function which returns numbers.

3)	Print :  Python 2x has no parenthesis 

4)	Error Handling : There is a small change in error handling in both versions. In python 
3.x, ‘as’ keyword is required.
